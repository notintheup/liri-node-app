++ NAME: LIRI Bot

## Overview

Make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

You can step through the commands to search for items of your liking. If you are unfamiliar with the commands simply start with:

**COMMAND START**
**node liri.js**
*This will give you an idea of how to proceed and a peek into the power of typing from CLI*
